# gatedelay
I needed to delay and extend gate and trigger signals for modular synthesis and logic applications.
Uses Arduino Promini and arduino sketch. 
Allows Delay the entire signal, or just the beginning of the signal while keeping release elements intact.

For more detail please see the blog post here--there are links to earlier posts while the build was being worked out.
